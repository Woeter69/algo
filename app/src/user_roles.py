User Roles Management Module

This module provides comprehensive user role management functionality for the alumni network platform.
It handles user role verification, permissions, access control, and community-based authorization.

Key Features:
- User role definitions and verification status management
- Database queries for user role information
- Permission checking functions for different access levels
- Flask decorators for route-level access control
- Community-based access management
- Verification request handling (simplified implementation)

Classes:
    UserRoles: Enumeration of available user roles
    VerificationStatus: Enumeration of verification request statuses

Functions:
    get_user_role_info: Retrieve comprehensive user role information
    is_admin: Check admin privileges
    is_verified_user: Check if user is verified
    can_access_community_features: Check community access permissions
    get_communities: Retrieve list of all communities
    submit_verification_request: Handle verification requests (simplified)
    get_pending_verification_requests: Get pending requests for admin (simplified)
    approve_verification_request: Approve verification requests (simplified)
    reject_verification_request: Reject verification requests (simplified)

Decorators:
    login_required: Ensure user is logged in
    verified_user_required: Ensure user is verified
    admin_required: Ensure user has admin privileges
    community_access_required: Ensure user has community access
