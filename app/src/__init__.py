# The __init__.py file serves as a package marker that tells Python to treat the src directory as a package, allowing files outside the 
# src folder to import modules and functions from within it.
# The __pycache__ folder is Python's way of making your code run faster by caching compiled bytecode. 
# It's automatically managed by Python, and you should ignore it in version control. which we are already doing btw.
