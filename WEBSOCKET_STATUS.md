# 🚀 WebSocket Integration Status

## ✅ **Completed**

1. **Go WebSocket Client** - Successfully loads and initializes
2. **Chat.js Updated** - Now uses Go WebSocket instead of Socket.IO
3. **Event Handlers** - Updated to use Go WebSocket events
4. **Message Handling** - Updated to handle Go WebSocket message format

## 🔄 **What Should Happen Now**

When you refresh the chat page, you should see:

```
🔥 Go WebSocket Client loaded!
⚡ This is much faster than Socket.IO
🚀 Ready to connect to Go server
🚀 Chat.ts initializing - DOM ready
Initializing Go WebSocket connection...  ← Changed from "Socket.IO"
```

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

1. **Refresh the chat page**
2. **Check console logs** - Should show Go WebSocket connection attempts
3. **Try sending a message** - Will use Go WebSocket client

## ⚠️ **Current Limitation**

The Go WebSocket server may still not be running in production due to the database connection issue you reverted. The client will show connection attempts but may fail to connect until the server is properly deployed.

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

- ✅ **Local Development**: Should connect to `ws://localhost:8080/ws`
- ❌ **Production**: May fail until Go server is deployed and running
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Will show user-friendly connection error messages

The chat interface now uses the Go WebSocket client instead of Socket.IO!
